- **This is magic**: Somehow the algorithm always converges to a number present in the array.

- **Key Learning #1: Leverage Binary Search for Range-Based Problems**  
  - **Why**: If the problem involves finding an element based on a count, position, or property within a range (like the Kth smallest), binary search can often be applied.  
  - **How**:  
    - Define the range (`l` and `r`), typically starting from the minimum and maximum possible values of the problem.  
    - Use `mid` to test whether the current candidate satisfies the required condition (like counting elements less than or equal to `mid`).  

- **Key Learning #2: Binary Search Can Work on Answers, Not Just Indexes**  
  - **Why**: Binary search is not just for searching elements in sorted arrays but also for searching over a possible range of answers when the solution can be described in terms of a condition.  

- **Key Learning #3: Generalize to Other Problems**  
  - **Why**: Many problems share this pattern of "find the Xth something," and the same binary search intuition applies.  
  - **Examples of Similar Problems**:  
    - Median of Two Sorted Arrays: Binary search on the smaller array.  
    - Split Array Largest Sum: Binary search on the possible range of sums.  
    - Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix: Binary search on value range using count.  
    - Aggressive Cows / Allocate Minimum Pages: Binary search on range of distances/pages.
